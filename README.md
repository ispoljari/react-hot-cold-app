## Description
This is a game where the user guesses a random number in the interval 1-100 set by the computer, and gets feedback in the form of the following words; cold, warm, hot, extremely hot.
The purpose is to guess the number in as little attempts as possible.
The user can track his progress because previous attempts are available.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
