## SUMMARY
This is a game where the user guesses a random number in the interval 1-100 set by the computer, and gets feedback in the form of the following words; cold, warm, hot, extremely hot.
The purpose is to guess the number in as little attempts as possible.
The user can track his progress because previous attempts are available.
